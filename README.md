# 🚀 Smart Rake Planner

**🌐 Live Demo:** [Smart Rake Planner](https://smart-rake-planner.vercel.app)


## 📌 Project Overview

**Smart Rake Planner** is an **AI/ML-inspired decision support system** designed to **optimize rake formation strategies** for large-scale steel logistics.  
It focuses on movements from **Bokaro Steel Plant to CMO stockyards and customer locations**.  

Rakes are full train-loads of wagons transporting bulk materials like **coal, iron ore, limestone, or finished goods**.  
Manual rake planning leads to:  
- ⏰ Delays in dispatch  
- 🚂 Underutilized rakes  
- 💰 Increased freight & penalties  

Smart Rake Planner **simulates an AI-powered system** that provides optimized rake plans to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and ensure timely deliveries.
